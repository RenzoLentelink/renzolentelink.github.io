          <p>Starting with the main character, Tanjiro.</p>
          <p>Tanjiro's distinctive hanafuda earrings have a deeper significance than just being a family heirloom. The design of the earrings has historical ties within the Demon Slayer Corps. They are reminiscent of the earrings worn by Yoriichi Tsugikuni, the legendary Sun Breathing swordsman who played a pivotal role in the history of demon slaying.
